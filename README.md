# dotfiles

This repo is for storing and versioning my dotfiles. Originally based a [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) from Atlassian.

## Usage
Use cgit command to manage config files.

cgit is an alias of git with working directory set to `$HOME` (defined in `.zsh/aliases`).

All files are hidden by default until explictly added with `cgit add [file]`.
