# dotfiles

This repo is for storing and versioning my dotfiles.

## Inspiration
Originally based on [Atlassian's tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

## Usage
Use cgit command to manage config files.

cgit is an alias of git with working directory set to `$HOME` (defined in `.zsh/aliases`).

All files are hidden by default until explictly added with `cgit add [file]`.
